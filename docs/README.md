The default Marathi INSCRIPT keboard on Windows 10 is missing the extended INSCRIPT layout proposed by "Enhanced INSCRIPT keyboard layout 5.2".  The enhanced layout still lacks access to punctuation via AltGr (or Ctrl + Alt) modifier key. Here, I present a modified "Enhanced INSCRIPT keyboard layout" that supports punctuation such as "?", "!", etc. without changing keyboard to English.
